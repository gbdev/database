    "description": "Willy Wonderworm is a game for the Nintendo Gameboy and Gameboy Color systems. It should operate under most emulators and on an actual Gameboy system if copied onto a cartridge. Note that the scrolling text on the title screen may not appear correctly on some emulators and we recommend that you use the nocash emulator (no$gmb).",
