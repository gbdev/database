This game was made as an entry for the PDRoms Coding Competition 3.33.

The game takes a common game type and adds the ability to edit sets of pieces that can then be used in the main game.

I am releasing this work into the public domain.  I really don't know what else to say about that.


=========
Main Game
=========

The main game is just as you might expect.  Pieces fall and must be moved and rotated to form complete horizontal lines which are then cleared.  A new level is reached after every 10 lines and the drop speed increases with every level.

To start the main game select "Play Set X" from the title screen.  The set used can be selected by pressing up/down on the D-Pad.  Sets 1-4 are the included piece sets.  Sets 5-8 can be edited in the piece editor and start out as a single piece made of a single block.

-----------------
D-Pad  - Move piece
A      - Rotate primary direction
B      - Rotate opposite direction

============
Piece Editor
============

The piece editor is used to edit sets of pieces to be used in the main game.  Sets 1-4 are stored in ROM and cannot be edited.  Sets 5-8 are stored in battery-backed RAM and can be edited.

To start the editor select "Edit Sets" from the title screen.

===========
High Scores
===========

There is a 1st, 2nd and 3rd place for every piece set.  Any changes made to a saved set (except for changing tile types) will result in the old highscores for that set being cleared once the set is played.
