	Linux : 
    Place this folder in your GBDK installation directory. Please use 
the latest GBDK version (2.96). Modify the first line of build.sh 
following your GBDK installation directory.

	Windows : 
    Place this folder in your GBDK installation directory and run build.bat.
However you will need to build GBDK 2.96 from the sources because there is no Windows 
build for this version.
