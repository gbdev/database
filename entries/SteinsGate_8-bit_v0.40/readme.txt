Steins;Gate 8-bit for Game Boy (Version 0.40, gbdev Gameboy Coding Compo 2014 entry)
by calc84maniac

Description:
  This is a clone/remake of the 8-bit sequel to the Steins;Gate anime/visual novel.
  Even though it's a non-canon spinoff, it does contain major spoilers for the original Steins;Gate story.
  It might not make sense unless you've watched/played Steins;Gate, which I highly recommend doing!
  The anime is available for purchase or streaming online, and the visual novel is available now at http://steins-gate.us/

Features:
  * The first four scenarios of the game, out of seven total
  * Vector graphics rendered in realtime
  * Textual command parsing engine
  * 10 slots for saving and loading games
  * Catchy tunes!

How to play:
  During novel sections, press any key to advance the text, or hold a key down to skip quickly through it.
  During command entry, move the cursor with the arrows, type characters with A, and delete characters with B.
  On the bottom, you can select between a keyboard, a list of common commands, and history of entered commands.
  You can also press SELECT to quickly switch between the keyboard and common commands.
  Select Enter and press A to submit your entered command. You can also press START to submit.
  To save or load the game, type "save" or "load" at the command prompt.
  
Commands:
  At certain points in the game, you will need to enter commands to decide what to do next.
  Here are some tips when entering commands, because it can be slightly confusing.
  I've tried to make this version a bit more lenient than the original game as to what commands you can enter,
   but it still helps to have the old-school text adventure mindset.
  There are usually three rules that valid commands follow:
   1) If you want to move in a direction, simply type the direction. (left, right, front, back, up, down, etc.)
   2) If you want to perform an action, simply type the action. (look, talk, eat, etc.)
   3) If you want to perform an action on a certain object, type the action then the object. (look poster, kick can, etc.)

  Full list of credits is in the game, but here are the credits for the GB version.

Future Plans:
  In the future, I plan to add the rest of the game's content. Save data should be compatible with future versions.
  I may add some color to the game in GBC mode. The only GBC feature currently in use is faster processing speed.
  
Change Log:
  Version 0.40:
  * First release of the GB version, featuring the first four scenarios of the game.
  * This version was entered into the gbdev Gameboy Coding Compo 2014.
