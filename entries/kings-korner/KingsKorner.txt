After writing Klondike, I had almost everything
needed for this game, so I went ahead and wrote
it in a few hours.  It is harder to win than it
first seems.  Please send *ANY* comments or
suggestions to my email address.

King's Korner Rules
_______________________________________________

The object of King's Korner is to deal all the cards from the deck onto 
the board and get rid of all cards other than the face cards.

There are only four limitations to how you can do this: 
 You cannot put a card on another card.
 You must put kings in the corner spaces.
 You must put jacks in the left and right non-corner spaces.
 You must put queenss in the top and bottom non-corner spaces.

Each time a card is dealt, click on the space (using the 'A' button) where
you want to put the card.

When you have filled all the spaces, you must then remove any tens or 
pairs of cards which add up to ten. You do this by clicking on the cards; 
if the card is a ten, it will be removed, otherwise a dot will be placed
on the card to indicate that it is active and you will need to click on 
another card which makes a total of ten.

When you have removed all the cards possible, click on the dealt card
hole or press the 'B' button and the cards will be dealt for you to refill 
the spaces.

You can get stuck in two ways: 
 You can't place a dealt face card in any of its appropriate spaces.
 You can't remove any cards after filling the spaces.
