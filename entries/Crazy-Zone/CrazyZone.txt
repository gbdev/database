Instruction :

Crazy Zone works only on Gameboy Color.

press A to fire.
press START to start or pause the game.

you've got 2 lives to finish the game. Each life contains 2 hearts.
When you collect 99 coins you win a life !

Crazy Zone have only 2 levels cause I haven't got enough time but they are
extremly hard (in my opinion ;-).
